## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a **mini self-driving car brain** built with **Python, OpenCV, and YOLOv8**.  
It takes a road video as input (`input.mp4`) and produces an output (`output.mp4`) showing:  
- Lane detection (green lines)  
- Object detection (cars, pedestrians, etc.)  
- Steering angle calculation  
- Motor speed decisions (Left/Right wheel %)  

At the same time, it also shows a **real-time simulator window**.

## 🎥 Input vs Output  

- **Input:** A driving video (`input.mp4`)  
- **Output:** A processed video (`output.mp4`) with AI overlays

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** (lane detection, video processing)  
- **YOLOv8** (object detection)  
- **NumPy, Math, tqdm**
